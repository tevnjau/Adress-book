# Adress-book
## Project Description
The Address Book is a web application that allows users to record and manage places they’ve visited. Users can enter the name, date, location, and a short description of each place. The app dynamically displays added places as cards on the page, and each card can be deleted. The goal is to keep a visual and interactive log of all visited locations.

## Functionality
The webpage is user-centric:
Given a user opens the Address Book web page
When they enter a place name, date, location, and description
Then the app creates a new place card and displays it on the page
And if any required fields are missing, the app alerts the user
And each place card can be deleted by clicking the Delete button
