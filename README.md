# Adress-book
## Project Description
The Address Book is a web application that allows users to record and manage places they’ve visited. Users can enter the name, date, location, and a short description of each place. The app dynamically displays added places as cards on the page, and each card can be deleted. The goal is to keep a visual and interactive log of all visited locations.
